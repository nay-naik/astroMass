weight on other planets
weight = mass x gravity

formula = weight of other body(planet) = weight on earth x multiple of earth's gravity

bodies values (multiple of earth's gravity)
sun = 2707(27.01)
moon = 16.6(0.166)
mercury = 38 (0.38)
venus = 91 (0.91)
earth = 100 (1)
mars = 38 (0.38)
jupiter = 234 (2.34)
saturn = 106 (1.06)
uranus = 92 (0.92)
neptune = 119 (1.19)
pluto = 6 (0.06)

for example:
you weigh 50 on earth let's find out how much you way on venus
weight on venus = 50 x 0.91 = 45.5
